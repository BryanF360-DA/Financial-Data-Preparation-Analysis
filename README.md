# Financial Data Preparation & Analysis

## Project Objective
The objective of this project was to source raw historical stock data for key tech companies (NVDA, MSFT, GOOG) and transform it into a clean, analysis-ready dataset. This project focuses on the critical data preparation skills required before any analysis or visualization can occur.

## Tools Used
* Google Sheets
* Yahoo Finance (for data sourcing)

## Key Activities
* **Data Sourcing:** Sourced and gathered raw daily stock data from Yahoo Finance.
* **Data Cleaning:** Performed extensive data cleaning and validation in Google Sheets to handle inconsistencies and ensure data integrity.
* **Feature Engineering:** Used advanced spreadsheet formulas to engineer a new, valuable feature: calculating the daily percentage return for each stock based on its adjusted closing price.

## Outcome
The primary outcome of this project was a clean, structured dataset with key performance metrics, ready for ingestion into a visualization tool like Tableau or Power BI. This demonstrates the ability to prepare complex, real-world data for analysis.
